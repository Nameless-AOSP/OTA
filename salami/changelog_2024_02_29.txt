- Initial Android 14 release and based on OOS 14.0.0.501(EX01)
- OOS 14.0.0.501(EX01) firmware included so no need to flash firmware manually.
- Clean flash required. Don't OTA or dirty flash from A13 build!

Below features were supposed to be added in initial release, but missed due to lack time development recently, will be gradually added in future:
- Pop Up View (Half ported)
- Game mode (A simple implementation without UI has been added)
