Device changelog
- Initial OOS 13 firmware build
- Improve color mode options and behavior to match OOS

Note
- Due to DDR type differs, firmware is not possible to included for 8T/9R for now. As a result, you can't directly upgrade to this build from OOS 12 based build. Here are two methods for upgrade: (1) Flash OOS 13 firmware manully before sideload this build. (2) Msm back to OOS 11, upgrade to OOS 13, then flash this build.
